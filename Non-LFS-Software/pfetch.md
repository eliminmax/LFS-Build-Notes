# pfetch

A system info display tool, written for POSIX-compliant shells.

Made by the same person as Neofetch. Output is much smaller, making it good as a pseudo-MOTD.

## Installation

```sh
wget https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch/archive/refs/tags/0.6.0.tar.gz -O pfetch-0.6.0.tar.gz
tar xf pfetch-0.6.0.tar.gz pfetch-0.6.0/pfetch --strip-components=1
sudo cp pfetch /usr/bin
```
