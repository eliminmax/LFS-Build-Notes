`xclip-0.13_eliminmax-unified-patch-1.patch` is the result of applying all seven patches included in the Debian source patches for xclip, which can be found [here](https://sources.debian.org/patches/xclip/0.13-2/), then creating a diff of the unpatched and patched source trees.

Similarly, `renameutils-0.12.0-eliminmax-unified-patch-1.patch` is the result of the same process, using the two Debian source patches for `renameutils` - those can be found [here](https://sources.debian.org/patches/renameutils/0.12.0-9/)
